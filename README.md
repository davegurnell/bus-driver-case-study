# Case Study: Gossiping Bus Drivers

## Description

Bus drivers like to gossip, everyone knows that.
And bus drivers can gossip when they end up at the same stop.
So now we are going to calculate
after how many stops all the bus drivers know all the gossips.

You will be given a number of bus routes that the drivers follow.
Each driver starts with one gossip.
Each route is appointed to 1 driver.
When 2 or more drivers are at the same stop (even if it is the start),
they can exchange all the gossips they know.

A route looks like this:

```
1 2 3 4
```

and is repeated over the whole day like this:

```
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 ...
```

If a driver starts and stops at the same stop then that is also repeated.
All drivers take 1 minute to go from one stop to another
and the gossip exchange happens instantly.
All drivers drive 8 hours a day
so you have a maximum of 480 minutes to get all the gossiping around.

### Input Description

You will receive all the driver routes. Not all drivers have a route of the same length. For example:

- Example 1:

  ```
  3 1 2 3
  3 2 3 1
  4 2 3 4 5
  ```

- Example 2:

  ```
  2 1 2
  5 2 8
  ```

### Output Description

The number of stops it takes to have all drivers on board with the latest gossips. If there is even one driver who does not have all the gossips by the end of the day, the answer is never.

- Example 1: 5
- Example 2: never

## Rules of Mob Programming

- One keyboard, one screen
- One driver, many navigators
- Rotate driver every 15 minutes
- Everyone gets time at the keyboard
- Complete each story (plan, code, test) before moving on
- Take breaks when you need to

## Rules of TDD

- Don't write any production code
  unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.

- Don't write any more of a unit test
  than is sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).

- Don't write any more production code
  than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
